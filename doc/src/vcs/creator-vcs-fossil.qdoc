    \title Using Fossil

    Fossil is an open source distributed version control system, designed
    and developed by the creator of SQLite. A stand-alone Fossil executable
    contains a source control management engine, web interface, issue tracker,
    wiki, and built-in web server. Fossil is available for Linux, Windows,
    and \macos.

    To use Fossil from \QC, you must install and configure it, as described in
    the following sections.

    \section1 Configuring Fossil

    \list 1
        \li Download the \l{http://fossil-scm.org}{Fossil SCM client} and
            install the \c fossil executable file in your \c PATH.

        \li Create or designate a directory to store local Fossil repositories
            and remote clones. For example: \c ~/fossils/qt.

        \li Configure \uicontrol {Version Control Options} for the Fossil plugin
           to use the designated directory as
           \uicontrol {Local Repositories Default path}.
    \endlist

    Now Fossil should become available as a VCS choice to create new local
    repositories, as well as a choice in \uicontrol {New File or Project} to
    clone a remote Fossil repository.

    \section1 Additional Fossil Functions

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l{Using Common Functions}, the \uicontrol Fossil submenu contains
    the following items:
    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Pull
            \li Pull changes from the remote repository.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Push
            \li Push committed changes to the remote repository.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Update
            \li Change the version of the current checkout. Any uncommitted
                changes are retained and applied to the new checkout.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Settings
            \li Configure the settings of the local repository.
    \endtable
